# Content child and content children

- It is a way to retrieve a child or children components 
instance and get access to its properties and methods

Step by Step:
- auth-form.component.html (lines: 16, 18, 19, 20)
- auth-form.component.ts (lines: 12, 14, 15, 21, 28-34)
- contentChildren works in the same way but, instead of using an object
directly you get an array of objects.
